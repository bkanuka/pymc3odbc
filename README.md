# pymc3odbc
ODBC pymc3 backend. Likely used to store traces in MS SQL Server

Currently this is realy just a PoC. However, it's based off of official backends, so it shouldn't be too bad ;-)

## TODO
Make documentation in case anyone finds this useful. It would also be nice to package this properly as a Python package.
